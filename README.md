Code for experiments using SPEIs.  Includes the code for the 3 experiments under a data starved scenario.  The first was on created regular polygon shape images.  The second was on a subset of the NLM NIH pill dataset.  The third was a galaxy shape dataset.  The fourth is on a subset of the MPEG-7 dataset.  Each experiment has its own branch with associated files.
