# SPEI Paper: Galaxy Experiment
Code for experiments regarding 2019 IEEE DSAA paper called "Shape Proportions and Encircled Image-Histograms Improve Analysis and Classification of Shapes for Small Data" for galaxy experiment (Ganalyzer: A Tool for Automatic Galaxy Image Analysis, Shamir, 2011).  The original image data is not provided here, but can be obtained from Shamir, 2011.  The EIs resulting from the image operators are provided, alongisde the code to perform the analysis.  The mgcreate custom library for Python must be obtained from "Image Operators: Image Processing in Python" by Jason Kinser.
