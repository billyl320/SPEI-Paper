# SPEI Paper: Created Regular Polygons Experiment
Code for the created regular polygons.  Code to create the shapes are provided.  The EIs resulting from the image operators are included, alongisde the code to perform the analysis.  The mgcreate custom library for Python must be obtained from "Image Operators: Image Processing in Python" by Jason Kinser. 

Two other unqiue experiments are also provided in this branch.  The first is an experiment to confirm that SPEIs is invarient to orientation. The second experiment provides experimental evidence for the number of observations needed for CNNs.
