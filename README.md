# SPEI Paper
Code for experiments regarding IEEE International DSAA paper called "Shape Proportions and Encircled Image-Histograms Improve Analysis and Classification of Shapes for Small Data".  Includes the code for the 3 experiments under a data starved scenario.  The first was on created regular polygon shape images.  The second was on a subset of the NML NIH pill dataset.  The third was a galaxy shape dataset.  Each experiment has its own branch with associated files.
