# SPEI Paper: Created Regular Polygons Experiment
Code for experiments regarding IEEE 2019 International DSAA paper called "Shape Proportions and Encircled Image-Histograms Improve Analysis and Classification of Shapes for Small Data" for the created regular polygons.  Code to create the shapes are provided.  The EIs resulting from the image operators are included, alongisde the code to perform the analysis.  The mgcreate custom library for Python must be obtained from "Image Operators: Image Processing in Python" by Jason Kinser.
